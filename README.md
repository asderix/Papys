     Python Rest-API as DAG

## Description
Rest-API as DAG is an approach in which the sequence of a request up to the response is described declaratively as a graph (hence Directed Acyclic Graph). This approach has crucial advantages:
1. The readability of the code is increased, the process could also be easily represented graphically and
2. the individual steps can be structured and reused in a natural way.
Papys is a concrete implementation of this approach. It also offers further advantages and is easy to use!
